## 🥾 Choose your adventure

There _so_ many ways to contribute to Mage! We welcome all contributions, no matter how small. 

Start your contribution journey below, wheter you're an *apprentice* or a *master of spells*. 👇

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="🧪 Alchemist">

Thanks for leading the charge! The easiest way to contribute is to report bugs or suggest new features.

### Report bugs

Head on over to our [Slack](https://mage.ai/chat) and let us know what's up. We recommend the #bugs-troubleshoot-questions channel.

### Squash bugs

We're always trying to make our project better, but we need your help! Take a look at our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/issues) for small to medium complexity projects and bugs that need fixing.

<Accordion title="🤹 Loremaster">
### Suggest new features
We _love_ your suggestions. First take a look at our [roadmap](/about/roadmap) to see if your idea is already planned. You might also consider checking out open issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai).

Otherwise, drop a line in our [Slack](https://mage.ai/chat) and let us know what you're thinking. We recommend the #feature-requests channel.

### Write documentation
We have _a lot_ of docs. We really hope they're fun to read, but we know they can be improved. 

The great news is that they're fun to write, too! The _easiest_ way to contribute is by scrolling to the bottom of the page you'd like to edit (maybe this one) and clicking the "Edit this page" link. You'll be taken to GitHub where you can make your changes and submit a pull request.

If you like working in code, that's great too! All of our docs are written in markdown, so you can just pull Mage from [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai) and start writing.

## 👾 Set up development environment

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init.sh [project_name]
   ```
2. Run the below script to build the Docker image and run all the services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh [project]
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can find more information about setting up your local environment for development [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/README_dev.md).

### Errors

#### Permission denied

If you get an error relating to permission denied when trying to execute a script,
it might have something to do with SELinux.

Two or more containers are trying to mount the same volume. With SELinux it’s not possible without
the `z` option.

For more information about using the `z` option,
read [Docker’s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).

---

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```
